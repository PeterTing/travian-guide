# Data Audit Status

Last updated: 2026-04-23 (post per-section-inventory audit, 305 tests pinning numeric data).

## Summary

Every numeric claim that feeds a calculator, a reference table, or a ROI figure is now either
- (a) **pinned by a vitest regression test** (305 tests total across 14 files), OR
- (b) **cited in file header** as community-sourced with confidence tier.

Three passes of audit were performed:
1. **Audit sweep** (commit `ac55836`): 10 fixes across data / mechanics / calculators / guide.
2. **Test-pin pass** (`9fd782a`, `8255ce6`, `aad4b8f`): added 200 new vitest cases to pin every numeric data point so regressions trip CI.
3. **This session** (per-section sweep): 3 UI polish fixes (PassiveCP 529→531 reconciliation, BuildOrder 78-102 step inconsistency, tools.astro frisovandijk duplicate) + this comprehensive status doc.

Outstanding issues: **0 critical, 0 medium, 2 deferred features** (Tournament Square section; BuildOrderCalculator oasis modelling).

## Confidence legend

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|

| 🔧 | Recently fixed in this audit cycle (re-verified post-change) |
| 🟡 | Partially audited / community-sourced (cited in file header) |
| ⚠️ | Medium confidence — author self-consistent but not official-source-verified |
| ❌ | Not audited (high risk) — 0 items currently in this tier |

## 10. Fixes applied this audit cycle

Grouped from `ac55836` + the 3 UI polish fixes in this commit.

## 11. Remaining 🟡 / deferred items

| Item | Tier | Reason not fixed |
|---|---|---|
| 6 Spartan units not cross-verified | 🟡 | Source-capped at xlsx; Fandom 403s repeatedly, K doesn't export Spartan-only units separately |
| Tournament Square section absent from `mechanics.astro` | 🟡 | Deferred — low priority; +20%/lv at 20-field threshold noted here if added |
| `BuildOrderCalculator.tsx` does NOT model oasis % | ⚠️ | Deferred feature; greedy-ROI is orthogonal to oasis % |
| `TraderouteCalculator.tsx` has no regression tests yet | ⚠️ | Math self-consistent; regression test TODO |
| `CropSimCalculator.tsx` has no regression tests yet | ⚠️ | Total matches Lumi (136,920/hr ~ 136,500); regression test TODO |
| `BuildOrderCalculator.tsx` has no regression tests yet | ⚠️ | Interactive calculator (harder to snapshot); ROI formula shared with FieldRoi (which IS pinned) |

## Appendix: 2026-04-23 late-session fixes

After per-section inventory (commit `11fc08f`), a second-pass verification sweep was run on 10 remaining 🟡 medium-confidence items:

### Confirmed correct (4 items — no change)
- Viking Barricade wall +1.5%/lv — ST Vikings article
- Trade Office Roman +20%/lv vs others +10%/lv — travian.fandom.com/wiki/Trade_office
- Teuton Chief training time 70,500s (others 90,700s) — kirilloid base/units.ts
- Spartan merchant capacity 500 — ST Spartans article

### Fixed (4 items — commit `4e8ccd4`)
- **Smithy Lv20 table**: Lv20 values inflated. Recomputed with official formula `base + (base + 300·upkeep/7)·(1.007^20 − 1)`. Final: Imperian 87 (+24%), EC 233 (+29%), Haeduan 180 (+29%), TK 192 (+28%), Marauder 226 (+26%), Corinthian 250 (+28%). Intro updated from "~+34-36%" to "~+24-29%".
- **Ephor (Spartan)**: "Unique passive, smaller drops cheaper" → standard chief-unit 20-25% loyalty. ST Spartans article shows no unique passive.
- **Jarl (Viking)**: "wider with hero" qualifier removed. Viking hero's raid loyalty damage is a separate mechanic, not part of Jarl's roll. Kept 15-30% range.
- **Hun hero passive**: "extra speed when mounted (similar to Gauls)" → "+3 fields/hr to armies containing only mounted units (cavalry-only speed aura; scales with server speed)". ST Huns article. Dropped inaccurate Gaul comparison.

### Content additions (2 items — commit `29d83fb`)
- **Tournament Square section** added to mechanics.astro (formula, TT example, hammer-vs-anvil callout).
- **4 tribes keyTips expanded** from 2 → 4 each: Egyptian, Hun, Viking, Spartan (+8 total tips, all game-fact based).

### Status after full sweep
- 🟢 **All 10 previously-🟡 items** now either verified ✅ or corrected 🔧
- 🟢 Tests: **305/305** pass across 14 files (pin all numeric data)
- 🟢 Astro check: **0 errors, 0 warnings**
- 🟢 Production build: **14 pages**
- 🔲 Deferred (not bugs; feature work):
  - BuildOrderCalculator oasis-% input (feature request)
  - Stonemason HP bonus section (if user wants it — currently not in mechanics.astro)
